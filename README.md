## Trails For All!
- Whether your whole lobby has this mod or just you, all players (from your perspective) will have trails!  
- Your own trail can be enabled or disabled (locally) via the ``Show Self Trail`` configuration item.  
- Trail Width & Length can be configured via the ``Trail Width`` and ``Trail Length`` configuration items.  
- Each trail will match it's player's color as shown below

## Visibility Controls
- If you'd like the ability to toggle the visibility of all trails with a keybind, enable the ``Add Visibility Control`` configuration item!
- When the ``Visibility Toggle Key`` is pressed, trails will be shown or hidden depending on their current status.
- The ``Visibility Press Delay`` configuration item determines how long after a key press the game will wait until listening for the next key press.
