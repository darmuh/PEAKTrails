- Trail Width & Length can be configured via the ``Trail Width`` and ``Trail Length`` configuration items.

### Visibility Controls
- If you'd like the ability to toggle the visibility of all trails with a keybind, enable the Add Visibility Control configuration item!
- When the ``Visibility Toggle Key`` is pressed, trails will be shown or hidden depending on their current status.
- The ``Visibility Press Delay`` configuration item determines how long after a key press the game will wait until listening for the next key press.
